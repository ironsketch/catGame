# CatPoop the Game #
### Made by: Michelle Bergin ###

This is a shitty game made in pygame. It's actually pretty fun to play, mostly cause of the pooping. I am slowly making it have more and more. I think my goal is to, in a way, emulate a rogue dungeon game but as a side scroller. You go as far as you can and maybe in the future you can slowly increment addons...? Not sure. It is way to early to know. Below is what I want to work on and what I have done. I am making this second repo because I really really want to get multiple classes working. 

Goals:

* ~~Fix collisions~~
* Have the kitty eat things (catnip and food etc.)
* ~~Smooth jumping~~
* ~~Barf Hairballs~~
* Gain points to earn upgrades
* Mythical poop upgrade
* Add evil-doers
* ~~Health Hearts (9)~~
* ~~Add distance counter~~
* Obsticles
* Water
* Lava
